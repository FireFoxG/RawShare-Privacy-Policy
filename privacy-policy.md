# Privacy Policy

RawShare is designed to help users transfer RAW and JPEG images from their camera to their smartphone, making it easy to view and share them on the go.
Information We Collect

We only collect the following types of data:

- Camera metadata (e.g. camera model, settings)

- Image metadata (e.g. file size, resolution, EXIF)

- Thumbnails and JPEG previews

- RAW image files (only if the user explicitly chooses to download them)

This data is used solely to enable core functionality — transferring, viewing, and sharing images — and is not shared with any third parties.


## Crash Reporting

We use Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google, to automatically collect anonymous crash reports. This helps us diagnose and fix technical issues in the app. Crashlytics may collect basic device information such as:

- Device type and model

- Operating system version

- App version

- Crash logs

No personally identifiable information is collected or stored through this process.
Data Sharing and Security

- We do not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties.

- All data remains local to your device unless you choose to share images through your own apps (e.g., messaging or cloud storage).
